Tutorials and interactive tours
===============================

We are caring about training. So we are working in close collaboration with the `Galaxy Training Network (GTN) <https://galaxyproject.org/teach/gtn/>`_ to develop training materials of data analyses based on Galaxy. These materials hosted on the `GTN GitHub repository <https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material>`_ are available online at `http://training.galaxyproject.org <http://training.galaxyproject.org>`_.

Tutorials
---------

We then developed `several tutorials with hands-one about metagenomics <http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/metagenomics/>`_:

    `Analyses of metagenomics data - The global picture <https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/general-tutorial/tutorial.html>`_

        This tutorial introduces the amplicon and shotgun data analyses with the general principles behind and the differences.

    `16S Microbial Analysis with Mothur <https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/mothur-miseq-sop/tutorial.html>`_

        In this tutorial the `Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) <https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP>`_ for MiSeq data, developed by the creators of the Mothur software package, is perfomed within Galaxy.

    `ASaiM-MT: Metatranscriptomics analysis using microbiome RNA-seq data <https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/metatranscriptomics/tutorial.html>`_

        Metatranscriptomics analysis enables understanding of how the microbiome responds to the environment by studying the functional analysis of genes expressed by the microbiome. In this tutorial, we will analyze time-series data of a microbial community inside a bioreactor

These tutorials can be run on ASaiM. We used then during several workshops on metagenomics data analysis using ASaiM as training support.

These tutorials are also accessible directly from ASAiM.

Interactive tours
-----------------

To complement these tutorials, interactive tours have been developed and integrated inside ASaiM. Such tours guide users through an entire analysis in an interactive (step-by-step) way.
