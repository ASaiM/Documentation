Raw sequences coming directly from DNA sequencers 

Some errors may be introduced during the sequencing. The quality control is an essential step to ensure that the raw data looks good and there are no problems of biases in data which may affect how usefully use it , ensure that the data used for downstream analysis is not compromised of low-quality sequences, sequence artifacts, ... that might lead to erroneous conclusions (Ã  reformuler, copier/coller de PRINSEQ)
