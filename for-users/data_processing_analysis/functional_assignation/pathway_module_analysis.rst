Analysis of pathways and modules
################################

Construction of metabolic networks as described by PeregrÃ­n-Alvarez et al 2009: enzymes (EC numbers) represented as nodes, substrates connecting two enzymes represented as edges in the network et enzyme-substrate relationships inferred from KEGG

iPath pathway mapping system : mapping the KEGG annotation of the identified protein sequences onto metabolic pathway maps

Indication of the gene expression levels of the metabolic pahways : log 2 values of the read count of KEGG annotated proteins

Creation of a global metabolic activity maps and other functional interpretations using reads with alignment bit-scores >= 74
