Assembly of paired-end sequences
################################

Paired-end sequencing generates, for each fragment, two sequences corresponding to both ends. Origin fragment information being present in sequence identifiant, the sequences of both ends can be concatenated into bigger sequences. This treatment increases information contained in each sequence and reduces the number of sequences to manipulated.
