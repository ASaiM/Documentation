ASaiM: an environment to analyze intestinal microbiota data
#######################################################################

*Auvergne Sequence Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota* (ASaiM) is an environment to analyze metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences from intestinal microbiota. `Read more about the project <http://asaim.github.io/about/>`_

The environment is constitued of:

An expert database combining information from analysis of intestinal microbiota
    This database is currently under construction

A framework to process and analyze intestinal microbiota from raw sequences to taxonomic and functional assignations
    This framework makes the connection between different tools and then generates pipeline that can then be executed in ASaiM environment. This framework in developped to be:

    - easy to use for all from beginners to expert. Check out :ref:`how to execute a pipeline analysis <installation-running-pipeline-execution>`
    - adjustable with numerous proposed tools. Check out :ref:`the available tools <>`


What now ?
----------

If you are a user and you want to use ASaiM to process and analyze metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences, check out the :ref:`Demo <demo>` and go to the :ref:`Utilisation manual <_for-users>`.

If you are an curious user or a potential developper and you want to have more information about ASaiM, go to :ref:` <for-devs>`.
