===========================================================

ASaiM (*Auvergne Sequence analysis of intestinal Microbiota*) is an environment to analyze microbiota, with a focus on intestinal microbiota. :ref:`Read more about ASaiM <environment>`.

This environment is composed of:

  A framework to process and analyze microbiota data from raw sequences to taxonomic and functional assignations. 
    :ref:`Read more about the framework <framework>` 

  An expert database which takes an inventory of gut microbiota data from public data repositories and users
    :ref:`Read more about the database <database>` *This database is currently under construction.* 

  A Web interface to submit and query the database
    :ref:`Read more about the web interface <web-interface>` *This web interface is currently under construction.* 

**What now?**

You have metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences on microbiota and you want to analyze them, check out the :ref:`tutorial of the framework <framework-tutorial>` and go to the :ref:`user manual <framework-use>`.

You want to query the expert database, check out the :ref:`database content <database>` and go the :ref:`user manual of the web interface <web-interface-user-manual>`.
