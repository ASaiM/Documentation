ASaiM: an environment to analyze intestinal microbiota data
###########################################################

*Auvergne Sequence Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota* (ASaiM) is an environment to analyze metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences from intestinal microbiota. `Read more about the project <http://asaim.github.io/about.html>`_

The environment is constituted of:

    An expert database combining information from analysis of intestinal microbiota
        This database is currently under construction

    A framework to process and analyze intestinal microbiota from raw sequences to taxonomic and functional assignations
        This framework makes the connection between different tools and then generates pipeline that can then be executed in ASaiM environment. It is developed to be:

        - easy to use for all from beginners to expert. Check by yourself :ref:`how to execute a pipeline analysis <installation-running-pipeline-execution>` and try it with the :ref:`demo <demo>` 
        - adjustable with numerous proposed tools. Check out :ref:`all the available tools <for-devs-framework-tools>`


What now ?
----------

If you are a user and you want to use ASaiM to process and analyze metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences, check out the :ref:`demo <demo>` and go to the :ref:`utilisation manual <for-users>`.
