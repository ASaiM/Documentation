ASaiM: an environment to analyze intestinal microbiota data
###########################################################

ASaiM (*Auvergne Sequence analysis of intestinal Microbiota*) is an environment to analyze intestinal microbiota. :ref:`Read more about ASaiM <environment>`.

This environment is composed of:

  A framework to process and analyze gut microbiota data from raw sequences to taxonomic and functional assignations. 
    This framework generates workflows with numerous different tools that can then be executed in the ASaiM environment. It is developed to be:

      - easy to use for all from beginners to expert. Check by yourself :ref:`how to construct and execute a workflow <framework-workflow>` or follow the :ref:`tutorial <framework-tutorial>` with available toy dataset 
      - adjustable with numerous proposed tools, databases, workflows. Check out all the available :ref:`tools <framework-tools>`, :ref:`databases <framework-databases>` and :ref:`workflows <framework-worflows>`.

    :ref:`Read more about the framework <framework>`

  An expert database which takes an inventory of gut microbiota data from public data repositories and users
    This database is currently under construction. :ref:`Read more about the database <database>`

  A Web interface to submit and query the database
    This web interface is currently under construction. :ref:`Read more about the web interface <web-interface>`


What now ?
----------

You have metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences on gut microbiota and you want to analyze them, check out the :ref:`tutorial of the framework <framework-tutorial>` and go to the :ref:`user manual <framework-use>`.

You want to query the expert database, check out the :ref:`database content <database>` and go the :ref:`user manual of the web interface <web-interface-user-manual>`.
