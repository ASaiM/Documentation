Tools 
#####

Several tools populate the Galaxy instance. And to conserve the idea of an Galaxy instance dedicated to analyses of gut microbiota data, the conserved tools were carefully choosen. 

Most of the common tools are coming from standard Galaxy instance. But specific tools such as the one dedicated to specific tasks are automatically imported from the `Galaxy Tool Shed <https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/>`_. However, wrappers of some of these tools were not complete (lack of some parameters, for example) and some wanted tools were not integrated in the  or `Galaxy Tool Shed <https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/>`_. Several wrappers were then developed and integrated in the `test Galaxy Tool Shed <https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu>`_. The corresponding source code are available in a `dedicated GitHub repository <https://github.com/ASaiM/galaxytools>`_.
