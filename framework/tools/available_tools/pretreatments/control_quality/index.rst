Control quality 
###############

During the sequencing, some errors may be introduced like incorporation of ambiguous nucleotides. Analyzing poor data wastes CPU and people time. The quality control is then an essential step to ensure that the raw data looks good. This step reduces the problems of biases in data which may compromised the downstream analyses with low-quality sequences, sequence artifacts, ... that might lead to erroneous conclusions.
