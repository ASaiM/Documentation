Workflow to analyze raw metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequences from microbiota
================================================================================

Extraction of useful information from raw microbiota sequences is a complex process with numerous steps.

   Workflow to process microbiota data from raw sequences to taxonomic,
   functional and taxonomically-related functional assignations

All steps and parameters are detailed in the :ref:`tutorial <framework-tutorial-analyses>`.

This workflow produces accurate and precise taxonomic assignations, multi-level functional results and taxonomically-related metabolism information, as described in the :ref:`validation section <framework-validation>`.

This workflow is built for single-end raw sequences. If you want to analyze paired-end sequences, we advise you to assemble them using one of :ref:`available tool for paired-end assembly <framework-tools-preprocessing-assemble>`.
