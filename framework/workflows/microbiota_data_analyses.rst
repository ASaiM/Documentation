   Workflow to process microbiota data from raw sequences to taxonomic,
   functional and taxonomically-related functional assignations

All steps and parameters are detailed in the :ref:`tutorial <framework-tutorial-analyses>`.

This workflow produces accurate and precise taxonomic assignations, multi-level functional results and taxonomically-related metabolism information, as described in the :ref:`validation section <framework-validation>`.
