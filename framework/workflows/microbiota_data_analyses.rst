Analyses of microbiota sequences 
================================

Extraction of useful information from raw microbiota sequences is a complex process with numerous steps.

   Workflow to process microbiota data from raw sequences to taxonomic and 
   functional assignations

These steps can be get together in 3 main steps, which are integrated as workflows 
in Galaxy instance:

- :ref:`Pretreatments <framework-workflows-microbiota-sequences-pretreatments>` to prepare raw sequences
- :ref:`Taxonomic analysis <framework-workflows-microbiota-sequences-taxonomic-analysis>` to extract microbiota structure
- :ref:`Functional analysis <framework-workflows-microbiota-sequences-functional-analysis>` to extract microbiota metabolism
