Comparative analysis workflows
==============================

Several workflows are also available to compare taxonomic results, functional results (gene families or pathways abundances, GO slim term abundances) and also taxonomically-related functional results between two datasets. These workflows take as inputs files generated using :ref:`main workflow <framework-workflows-microbiota-sequences>`.
