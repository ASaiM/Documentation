ASaiM framework
===============

New sequencing platforms produce huge amount of short reads. Notwithstanding, inappropriate use of sequence analysis procedures may result in numerous errors and misinterpretation. This is particularly true for exploration of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from complex microorganims communities colonizing all environments. Hence as these communities are highly studied, there is an urgent need for modular, accessible and sharable user-friendly tools.

ASaiM is an open-source opinionated framework dedicated to microbiota sequence analyses. With a selected collection of tools, workflows and databases, ASaiM helps exploitation of taxonomic and metabolic information from raw microbiota sequences, using a custom Galaxy instance

This framework is developed to :

      - be easy to use for all from beginners to expert. Check by yourself :ref:`how to construct and execute a workflow <framework-workflow>` or follow the :ref:`tutorial <framework-tutorial>` with available toy dataset
      - incorporate numerous but carefully selected tools. Check out all the available :ref:`tools <framework-tools>`.
      - help generation of modular workflows. Look at the availables :ref:`workflows <framework-workflow>`.
      - improve transparency and reproducibility of microbiota studies

ASaiM provides therefore a powerful framework to easily and rapidly exploit microbiota data in a reproducible and transparent environment.
