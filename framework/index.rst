ASaiM framework 
===============

To understand a microbiota environment, we need answers to questions as "Who is there?", "What are they doing?" and "How are they doing it?". This can be achieved by analyses of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences sampled from interesting environment. These analyses are a complex process with numerous steps:

1. Quality control
2. (Assembly of sequences)
3. Sort of interesting sequence
4. Functional annotation
5. Taxonomic analysis
6. Comparative analysis

To achieve these tasks, :ref:`ASaiM framework <framework>` provides a Galaxy environment to help analyses of gut microbiota data with selected tools, databases and workflows.

This framework is developed to be:

      - easy to use for all from beginners to expert. Check by yourself :ref:`how to construct and execute a workflow <framework-workflow>` or follow the :ref:`tutorial <framework-tutorial>` with available toy dataset 
      - adjustable with numerous proposed tools, databases, workflows. Check out all the available :ref:`tools <framework-tools>`, :ref:`databases <framework-databases>` and :ref:`workflows <framework-workflow>`.
