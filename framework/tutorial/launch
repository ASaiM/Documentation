Launch the framework
====================

Once installed and configured, the Galaxy instance on which the framework is based can be :ref:`launched <framework-use-launch>`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./src/launch_galaxy.sh

This task can take some times because it launch a Galaxy instance and populates it with tools, databases, workflows. 

The Galaxy instance can be browsed on `http://0.0.0.0:8080/ <http://0.0.0.0:8080/>`_.

Galaxy is simple to use. You can check these videos for more informations. Some documentation is also available on :ref:`tool usage <framework-tools-usage>` and :ref:`workflow usage <framework-workflow-usage>`.
